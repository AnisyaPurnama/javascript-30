# JavaScript 30

[The JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) is an outstanding series of 30 video tutorials by Wes Bos. Each tutorial builds a small, interesting project from scratch using plain JS, CSS & HTML.

You'll be using these tutorials as a chance to practice refactoring code from one file to many, and to practice collaborative development. Using his tutorials as a starting point, you will work in teams to rebuild as many group projects as possible using the [javascript-30-starter repo](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/javascript-30-starter).

The first couple challenges you try to build as a group will be difficult. You'll have many merge conflicts, difficulty dividing the work, and will certainly feel like it's much more work than just building the project in one file. And it will be more work! But worth it. Learning how to separate projects by concern, and practicing collaboration with branches, milestones, issues & pull requests on small projects now will help you understand larger projects later on.

## Helping Each Other

Got a question? Got a tip? Use the issues in [HackYourFutureBelgium's fork](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/javascript-30/issues)!

Some guidelines for using the issues:

- Attach a label with the challenge name in kebab case -> `drum-kit`, or `slide-in-on-a-scroll`
- Let us know if it's a question or a helpful tip -> `question`, `tip`
- @mention someone if you know they have the same question, or think they could help you
- If you create a `question` issue and your question has been answered, please close the issue
- Be nice and have fun!

## Examples to Study

This repository contains a few [examples to study](./examples-to-study), but don't stop there!

Explore other people's forks to see how they have approached the same projects.

## Starter Repo

There is a starter repo to help your team get going, no need to start from an empty project :)

## Collaborative Development

Your main objective with these exercises is to practice working with others on one shared code base. For each of the group challenges you should work in small groups to break down the project into user stories and create a full project repository one step at a time. A finished project repository will have:

- A backlog and development strategy breaking down the finished project into clear steps.
- One milestone per user story
- One issue per task (file of code, bug, improvement, ...), labeled by concern.
- A project board to organize the issues.
- One branch per task, each merged into _master_
- The finished code for your project should separated into multiple folders and files according to separation of concerns.
- A live demo on GitHub pages
- Project documentation including a complete README, and clear JSDocs for each piece of code.

After finding a team and picking a challenge, you should ...

### 0. Independent Study

Each person in your group should study the challenge independently, following the video tutorial and studying Wes Bos' finished example code. After following the tutorial spend some time figuring out how you would separate his code by concern.

### 1. New Repository

Choose one of your team members to be the Repository Owner, they will create a new repository using the [javascript-30-starter](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/javascript-30-starter) and rename it after the project you're building. You will use this repository for everything, the project board, issues, development strategy, branches, code and demo.

- Add the other team members as collaborators on the main repo.
- Turn on GitHub Pages, your most recent work should always be live!

Before moving on, take a moment to add a link to your team's repo in the README of your fork of `javascript-30` (this file).

### 2. New Feature

As a team discus the finished tutorial code come up with one new feature you would like to add, beyond what Wes Bos has implemented. This can be anything!

### 3. Project Planning

Work together to write a `development-strategy.md`:

- How do you want to break this project into user stories? (including your new user story!)
- What's a good way to organize the code for this project? What folders & files make sense to have?
- What code do you need to write for each user story? Which folders and files will you need to work on?
- Include a wireframe or figma document for your finished project.
- How much work/time do you expect each task to be?

### 4. Project Management

1. Create one milestone for each user story.
1. Create one issue for each task that needs to be completed (ie. one piece of code: a single listener, a single handler, a logic function, a style class, ...)
   - Assign it to the correct User Story milestone.
   - Label the issue based on it's concern (ie. handler, logic, listener, style, ..)
   - Assign each issue to one of your team members
1. Create a new project board in the new project repository and move all of your issues onto the board.

### 5. Developing

Get coding!

- Develop each task on a separate branch, merging to master only when it is complete.
- Each person should complete their tasks (write their code) a new branch.
  - When a task/issue is complete, they should send a pull request with their code to the master branch. Assign group members to review the pull request.
  - After all assigned group member has approved the pull request, it can be merged to the main/master branch

### 6. Documenting

After all user stories are complete & merged to master, and after all of your issues are closed, it's time to put on the finishing touches.

Fill out a complete README.md to document your project and take a last look over your project's documentation.

### Repeat!

There are 24 group projects, keep working your way through them all until you can collaborate in your sleep.

## The Challenges

Like the title says, there are 30 challenges. Most of them are full projects with HTML, CSS & JavaScript - these are for group study. But a few of them are more focused on a specific JS skill - these are for you to study independently in your own repository.

As you work your way through the 30 challenges you should check them off in the lists below and provide a link to the repository with your solution. If it's a group project link to the main group repository, not your fork of this reop.

### For Group Study

Each time you finish one of these group challenges, check it off (`- [x]`) and provide a link to the new repository your group used to collaborate on this challenge.

### For Solo Study

These exercises are to study individually. Because these are challenges without a full user interface, you don't need to do any of the extra steps with development strategies, new repositories, user stories or branches. You can put your finished code and notes directly in the [./solo-study](./solo-study) folder on your fork of this repository.

Looking for a little more workflow practice? Try using a project board and issues in your fork of this repo to track your progress through these exercises.

- [ ] 04 - array cardio day 1
- [ ] 06 - array cardio day 2
- [ ] 09 - dev tools domination
- [ ] 14 - javascript reverences vs copying
- [ ] 18 - Adding Up Times with Reduce
- [ ] 25 - Event Capture, Propagation, Bubbling
